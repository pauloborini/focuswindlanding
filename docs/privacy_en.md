# Privacy Policy

**Version:** 1.0.0\
**Last updated:** February 28, 2026

Welcome to FocusWind (developed by Borini Software). Your privacy is of the
utmost importance to us. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use,
share, and protect your information when you use our Pomodoro application for
macOS and associated platforms.

## 1. Information We Collect

- **Account Data:** When creating an account, we may collect your name, email
  address, and profile information.
- **App Usage Data:** We collect information about how you interact with our
  features (such as Pomodoro settings and cycle history) to provide and improve
  the service.
- **Device Data:** We collect information like your device model, IP address,
  operating system, and unique identifiers to support app development and
  security.
- **Subscription Info:** We handle details regarding subscription purchases
  (e.g., current plan). We DO NOT directly store your full credit card data
  (this is managed by our third-party payment providers).

## 2. How We Use Your Information

We use the collected information to:

- Provide, operate, and maintain FocusWind.
- Improve, personalize, and expand our application.
- Understand and analyze how you use our services.
- Seamlessly back up and sync your Pomodoro settings and profile configuration
  on the cloud.
- Communicate with you (for technical support or updates).

## 3. Information Sharing

We do not sell and will never sell your personal data. Your data may be shared
with:

- **Service Providers:** Third-party companies that assist us with internal
  operations (e.g., cloud database providers, analytics tools, and payment
  processors).
- **Legal Requirements:** If required to do so by local and international laws,
  valid subpoenas, or judicial requests.

## 4. Data Security

Data security is essential to us. We use the Supabase infrastructure for our
database and authentication, enforcing high-security standards (including
encryption at rest and secure local storage via Hive and Flutter Secure
Storage). However, no internet transmission is 100% secure.

## 5. Children's Privacy

FocusWind is not intended for individuals under the age of 13. We do not
knowingly collect information from children. If we become aware that we have
collected such data, we will take steps to securely delete it.

## 6. Changes to this Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy periodically. Upon doing so, we will update
the version and date at the top of this document. We suggest checking it
periodically for changes.
